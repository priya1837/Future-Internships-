task 1
The project TikTok Game is a simple two-player game developed in Java. It is based on the classic Tic Tac Toe game, where a 3×3 grid is used and players take turns placing their marks, either ‘X’ or ‘O’. The objective of the game is to form a straight line of three marks either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The program includes features such as input validation, board display, checking for winning conditions, and detecting a draw. It also provides the option to replay after a game ends. The project demonstrates the use of arrays, loops, conditional statements, and methods in Java to implement an interactive



task 2
The program Random Password Generator is a Java application used to create secure and customizable passwords. It allows the user to choose the password length and whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

The program ensures that if a character type is selected, at least one character from that category will be present in the final password. The remaining characters are randomly selected from the combined set of chosen categories. To enhance security, the generated characters are shuffled before forming the final password.
If the user enters a password length smaller than the minimum required (based on selected categories), or if no character type is chosen, the program displays an error message. Otherwise, it prints the secure password to the user




task 3a
The Number Guessing Game is a Java program where the computer randomly picks a number between 1 and 100. The user tries to guess the number. After each guess, the program tells whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. The game continues until the user guesses the right

task 3b
The Simple Calculator program in Java takes two numbers and an operator from the user. It performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on the operator and shows the result. If the operator is invalid or division by zero happens, it shows an error
